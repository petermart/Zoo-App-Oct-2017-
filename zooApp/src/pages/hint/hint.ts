Its habit of charging at moving objects makes it a mammal to be avoided, especially since its eyesight isn't great.</p><p>This species has two horns. The front (anterior) horn is larger and measures up to 55 inches, while the rear (posterior) horn is smaller and measures up to 22 inches. Rhino horns are made of keratin, or densely compressed hair. Keratin is the same material that makes up human hair and fingernails.</p><h2>What's in a Name?</h2><p>___ ___ are actually not ___ at all. The species probably derives its name as a distinction from the white rhino (itself a misnomer) and/or from the dark-colored local soil that often covers its skin after wallowing in mud.</p><h2>Territorial Vegetarians</h2><p>Living primarily in grasslands, savannahs and tropical bush lands, ___ rhinos are browsers with prehensile upper lips adapted for grasping and holding leaves and branches of shrubs and trees.</p><p>___ rhinos are semi-social and territorial. Adult females have overlapping ranges while males are generally solitary and may be territorial. ___ rhino home ranges vary greatly depending on the habitat and to some extent on sex and age.</p><p>___ rhinos may live up to 35 years in the wild. Females reach sexual maturity between ages 4 and 7; males mature between ages 7 and 10. Gestation lasts approximately 14-16 months, with a single calf being the norm every 2-1/2 to 3 years.</p><h2>Critically Endangered</h2><p>Millions of years ago, rhinos could be found in North America and Europe as well as in Africa and Asia. There are five surviving rhino species, three of which are critically endangered. The ___ rhino and white rhino are found in Africa, while the greater one-horned rhino, Sumatran rhino, and Javan rhino call Asia home.</p><p>During the last century, the ___ rhino has suffered the most drastic decline in total numbers of all rhino species. Between 1970 and 1992, its population dropped by 96%. By 1993, only 2,300 individuals survived in the wild. The current population is estimated to be 5,055.</p><h3>Illegal Poaching</h3><p>The ___ ___ has been pushed to the brink of extinction by illegal poaching for their horns, and to a lesser extent by loss of habitat. A major market for these horns, Arab nations use them to make ornately carved handles for ceremonial daggers. The horn is also falsely believed to be medicine in many Asian cultures. Rhino horn is made of keratin, which is the same protein that makes up hair and fingernails. With the growing purchasing power of many Asian countries and the existence of organized gangs of poachers, the threat to rhinos remains great.<span style=\"font-size: 1.6rem;\"> </span></p><img border=\"0\" class=\"ccm-image-block\" alt=\"\" src=\"/files/4314/7449/2255/Rhino-Poaching-Chart-2016.jpg\" width=\"800\" height=\"590\" /><h3>Help for Rhinos</h3><p>In response, a group of concerned individuals and institutions founded the ___ Rhino Foundation in 1989. In 1993, this foundation expanded its mission and became the <a href=\"http://www.rhinos.org/\">International Rhino Foundation</a>, which is dedicated to rhino conservation and research. Conservationists' intensive anti-poaching efforts had encouraging results in the 1990s and 2000s and the number of ___ rhinos in the wild began increasing very slowly. Unfortunately, there has been a resurgence of poaching in recent years and this activity is again posing a significant threat to wild ___ rhino populations. Current estimates show 5,055 individual ___ rhinos are now alive - all precious representatives of the glorious history of the rhino family.</p><h2>Zoo Supports Conservation in the Wild</h2><p>The Saint Louis Zoo's WildCare Institute <a title=\"Conservation in the Horn of Africa\" href=\"/conservation/wildcare-institute/conservationinthehornofafr/\">Center for Conservation in the Horn of Africa</a> was established to provide<em> in situ</em> and <em>ex situ</em> conservation support for the wildlife of the Horn of Africa. This center's work in Kenya with the Northern Rangelands Trust benefits ___ rhinos. In addition, each year the <a title=\"American Association of Zoo Keepers\" href=\"/animals/soyouwanttobeazookeeper/americanassociationofzooke/\">St. Louis Chapter of American Association of Zoo Keepers</a> (AAZK) sponsors Bowling for Rhinos, a fundraising bowl-a-thon which supports the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in Kenya, Ujung Kulon National Park in Java, Indonesia and Bukit Barisan Selatan and Way Kambas National Parks in Sumatra.</p><p>On March 11, 2016 a female ___ rhino in Sera Community Rhino Sanctuary, Kenya, gave birth to a healthy calf, and made history. This is the first ___ rhino to be born on community land in northern Kenya for over 25 years, and demonstrates the strength of the growing community conservation movement. The calf also represents the community's hopes that the Sanctuary can nurture a viable breeding population of ___ rhino; that could eventually help repopulate other community conservation areas. <a href=\"http://www.nrt-kenya.org/news-list/2016/3/21/press-release-sera-community-rhino-sanctuary-celebrate-first-___-rhino-birth\">Read more</a>. The Zoo's WildCare Institute and AAZK have provided funding to the Sera Community Rhino Sanctuary.</p><h2>At the Saint Louis Zoo</h2><p>Because of their endangered status, the Zoo's ___ rhinos are part of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' ___ Rhino Species Survival Plan (SSP), a program to manage a genetically healthy population of ___ rhinos in North American zoos. Currently there are 60 ___ rhinos in 26 institutions. In all, 10 ___ rhino calves have been born at the Saint Louis Zoo.</p><p>Ruka, the first ___ ___ to be born at the Saint Louis Zoo in 20 years was born January 14, 2011, to first-time parents, mother Kati Rain and father Ajabu. At age 4, Ruka moved to the Oregon Zoo to pair with a compatible female at the recommendation of the SSP. Ruka's parents live at River's Edge.</p><p>Male calf <a title=\"Rhino Calf\" href=\"/animals/abouttheanimals/mammals/hoofedmammals/______/rhinocalf/\">Moyo</a> was born on May 17, 2017 to the same parents. His name means \"heart\" in Swaheli. He weighed in at 130 pounds at 1 week old and tipped the scales at 205 pounds at 1 month old.</p>        </section>";

Whether it\'s their key role in the Hindu religion and culture, their longstanding use as beasts of burden, their slaughter for the ivory trade, or their current conflicts with the exploding human population -- ___s have always fascinated us.</p><p>___s have been domesticated in Asia for centuries, bred to move people and cargo. In the past, wealthy Indians and royalty owned ___s, riding on their elaborately decorated backs on hunting trips into the bush. Because they are intelligent and docile (when well treated), they have been widely used in the lumber industry to haul heavy items such as teak logs.</p></div>    </li>      <li>      <input type="radio" name="accordion-30306" id="toggle-30306-2" >      <label for="toggle-30306-2"><span>An Imposing Body Plan</span></label>      <div><p>___s are the largest living animals on land, they have the biggest brains in the animal kingdom and form close, long-lasting social bonds. No wonder they capture our imaginations.</p><p>Even though Asian ___s are smaller than their African cousins, they still get up to 7-12 feet tall and weigh between 6,600 and 11,000 pounds. (The massive skull makes up 12 to 25 percent of their body weight!) Their broad feet distribute their bulk so well that ___s hardly leave any tracks when they walk.</p><p>Because of their large size, ___s can\'t reach the ground with their mouth. Natural selection solved this problem over the millennia by lengthening the animals\' upper lip and nose into a trunk. The trunk is not only used for feeding, but for a host of other behaviors, including drinking, greeting, caressing, fighting, squirting water and throwing dust.</p><p>The well-known tusks of ___s are actually two enlarged upper teeth that grow throughout their lives. In Asian ___s, the larger tusks of the males protrude from their mouth, while the females\' tusks (called "tushes") are so small they don\'t extend beyond the lip. The molars fall out at the front when they\'re worn, and replacement teeth move forward as the ___ ages.</p><p>The skin of an ___ is thick and dry, with short, stiff hairs. The skin color varies from gray to brown (though the true color is often masked by the color of the soil where they live, since they constantly throw dirt over their back as a sunscreen and insect repellent.)</p></div>    </li>      <li>      <input type="radio" name="accordion-30306" id="toggle-30306-3" >      <label for="toggle-30306-3"><span>A Hearty Appetite, a Big Thirst</span></label>      <div><p>Asian ___s eat a varied diet of grasses, fruit, vegetables, bark, roots, leaves and stems. It takes a lot of food to sustain their big bodies: an adult eats between 165 and 330 pounds of food in one day, though less than half of this is well digested.</p><p>Unfortunately for the ___s, they also have craving for crops like cereal grasses, bananas, and sugar cane. As a result, the animals often become pests in farm regions. They risk getting shot when they manage to evade farmers\' fences, moats and other defenses.</p><p>___s don\'t feed for more than a few days in any one place. And since they drink at least once a day, they don\'t wander far away from a water source. ___s\' thirst for water is nearly as big as their appetite for food: they drink 20 to 40 gallons of water every day! (By the way, they drink by sucking water into their trunk, then pouring it into their mouths.)</p></div>    </li>      <li>      <input type="radio" name="accordion-30306" id="toggle-30306-4" >      <label for="toggle-30306-4"><span>Keeping in Touch</span></label>      <div><p>Although Asian ___s\' ears are smaller than those of African ___s, both types have very good hearing. Their sense of smell is also excellent (which you might expect from an animal with such a long nose)! Smell plays a large role in their social life, and in their ability to detect predators.</p><p>The sense of touch is also highly developed in ___s. The trunk has fine hairs at the tip that make it extremely sensitive. ___s often touch each other with their trunk.</p><p>Another way that ___s maintain close social bonds is with the sounds they produce. The most common sound is a low growl (what some people call a "tummy rumble"), which they use to maintain contact with each other. This growl can be heard for more than a half-mile.</p><p>___s also communicate via low-frequency "infrasound," below the range of human hearing. Depending on weather and atmospheric conditions, scientists think these sounds may carry for distances of more than 100 miles! Long-distance calling is used in a number of situations, such as in times of distress. And it is apparently crucial to courtship and mating, since females use it to call males when they\'re ready to breed.</p></div>    </li>      <li>      <input type="radio" name="accordion-30306" id="toggle-30306-5" >      <label for="toggle-30306-5"><span>That\'s Some Baby!</span></label>      <div><p>It\'s no small matter bringing a baby Asian ___ into the world! First, the mother carries a baby nearly 22 months - the longest pregnancy of any land animal. Then there\'s the size of the calf - it weighs between 250 and 350 pounds at birth. Ouch!</p><p>During a birth, other females in the herd often act as "midwives," clustering around the new baby, even helping it to its feet. A newborn ___ can stand shortly after birth. It will nurse (with its mouth, not its trunk) between two to four years. Youngsters begin eating some grass at several months old; solid food becomes an increasing part of their diet as they get older.</p><p>A young ___ takes a long time to mature, but the job of raising it doesn\'t just belong to its mother: the entire family gets into the act. When a potential predator such as a lion or tiger threatens a calf, the adults form a defensive circle around it to protect the baby. In addition, one or two juvenile females in the family often act as "babysitters" and look after the youngster.</p><p>Female calves remain in a herd with their other female relatives throughout their lives. Males leave their herd when they reach puberty.</p></div>    </li>      <li>      <input type="radio" name="accordion-30306" id="toggle-30306-6" >      <label for="toggle-30306-6"><span>The Herd Mentality</span></label>      <div><p>___s are social creatures. They live in groups (often the same groups for their entire lives) and display complex social behavior. The basic group structure is a herd of two to 20 females and their offspring, averaging seven animals per herd. The group is led by a "matriarch," usually the oldest and most experienced female in the herd. She coordinates the ___s\' movements in search of food and water.</p><p>After males reach puberty, they travel alone or in temporary male groups.</p></div>    </li>      <li>      <input type="radio" name="accordion-30306" id="toggle-30306-7" >      <label for="toggle-30306-7"><span>Shapers of their World</span></label>      <div><p>___s play such a vital role in their ecosystem that they are known as a "keystone" species. This means they modify their habitat in ways that affect a host of plant and animal species.</p><p>Asian ___s provide water for other types of animals by digging water holes in dry seasons (they have an amazing ability to locate underground water). Their movements carve "roads" through the bush, used by many other animal species, including humans. They also create clearings in the forest by pulling down trees to get to the leaves. ___s also disperse the seeds of fruit trees by depositing them in their dung during their travels.</p></div>    </li>      <li>      <input type="radio" name="accordion-30306" id="toggle-30306-8" >      <label for="toggle-30306-8"><span>On the Brink of Extinction</span></label>      <div><p>Asian ___s are in trouble today more than ever before. They\'ve been hunted for the past 150 years for their tusks, which supply the profitable but destructive ivory trade. As if that weren\'t enough, they are now losing their land to the increasing human population throughout Asia. Across much of the ___s\' range, their forest and grassland habitat is being transformed into farmland and villages. Adding to the problem is the increasing commercial demand for forest-derived products such as coffee, tea, rubber, and hardwoods.</p><p>Only about 35,000 to 40,000 Asian ___s survive today in fragmented populations - a small fraction of the numbers that used to range throughout most of Asia. The species faces a real risk of becoming extinct in the wild. Many groups and governments are working to help Asian ___s: an international agreement bans the trade in ___ products. Zoos and other conservation organizations are also doing what they can (see side story).</p><p>You can also help by refusing to buy products made from ivory or other ___ parts, and by making sure the forest products you purchase come from sustainable producers.</p></div>    </li>      <li>      <input type="radio" name="accordion-30306" id="toggle-30306-9" >      <label for="toggle-30306-9"><span>Fun Facts</span></label>      <div><ul><li>An ___\'s trunk can get very heavy, so it\'s not uncommon to see an ___ resting its trunk over a tusk!</li><li>At full charge, an ___ can run over 30 miles an hour.</li><li>The average lifespan of an ___ in the wild and in zoos is 45 years.</li><li>Contrary to popular belief, ___s don\'t really make "graveyards" for the dead members of their family.

However, this fast cat can only maintain its top speed for short distances (less than one-half mile, due to a poor internal cooling system).</p><h2>Built for Speed</h2><p>___s are made for sprinting. Their slender, streamlined body allows fast runs and their flexible spine and long legs enable the cat to take big strides. They also have over-sized lungs, heart, and breathing passages, so they\'re able to pump more oxygen during runs. Their long tail acts like a counter balance when running, and semi-retractable claws provide better traction during sprints.</p><p>Being fast helps ___s chase down prey, but these cats also have other traits that help them hunt. Their spotted coat provides good camouflage -- perfect for sneaking up on unsuspecting victims! And the black "teardrops" under each eye may enhance their vision by reducing glare from the sun.</p><h2>On the Hunt</h2><p>Early morning and late afternoon are prime hunting times for ___s. The first step is to locate the prey. To do this, ___s often sit on a termite mound or tree limb to scan the countryside. Though they like gazelles best, ___s also keep an eye out for impalas, springhares, birds, and the young of warthogs, kudu, hartebeest, and other mammals.</p><p>Once a ___ has selected its prey, the chase begins! The ___ tries to get within 50 yards of the intended victim before accelerating to top speed. Most sprints last only about twenty seconds (and rarely exceed one minute). During the chase, the ___ uses its front claws to trip its prey. The cat quickly dispatches its victim with a bite to the throat (or through the skull, for small animals).</p><p>___s usually eat every two to five days. And they must eat quickly, because their food is often stolen by larger, more powerful animals (like lions, leopards, and hyenas).</p><h2>Not Your Average Kittens</h2><p>For ___s, the peak season for births is March through June (though they can breed any time of year). A female gives birth to a litter of one to eight cubs, with four being the average. At birth the cubs are about one foot long and weight only one-half pound. They\'re gray in color, and have a mantle of mane-like hair that may provide camouflage when the youngsters are laying in the grass.</p><p>During the first few weeks of life, the mother moves her cubs often to avoid enemies. But she has to leave them alone when she goes off to hunt, and during these times many cubs are killed by lions and other predators.</p><p>When cubs are about six weeks old, they start to follow their mom around and to learn how to hunt. They remain with her for 13 to 20 months. Young ___s are fully mature at about two years of age.</p><h2>Race for Survival</h2><p>___s are in trouble in the wild. In the last century, the ___ population has declined from 100,000 to fewer than 10,000 individuals, and the species has become extinct in at least 13 countries.</p><p>___s face many problems, including habitat loss, poaching, and competition with large predators. They also run into trouble with ranchers, who often mistakenly blame ___s for livestock losses -- and shoot them. Finally, ___s lack genetic diversity. This means that individuals in the population are very closely related, and so are at greater risk from diseases.</p><p>Is anything being done to help ___s? Yes! Various conservation organizations, including the Saint Louis Zoo, are working to save these animals before it\'s too late. Through their efforts, ___s may win their race for survival.

Its habit of charging at moving objects makes it a mammal to be avoided, especially since its eyesight isn\'t great.</p><p>This species has two horns. The front (anterior) horn is larger and measures up to 55 inches, while the rear (posterior) horn is smaller and measures up to 22 inches. ___ horns are made of keratin, or densely compressed hair. Keratin is the same material that makes up human hair and fingernails.</p><h2>What\'s in a Name?</h2><p>___ ___ are actually not ___ at all. The species probably derives its name as a distinction from the white ___ (itself a misnomer) and/or from the dark-colored local soil that often covers its skin after wallowing in mud.</p><h2>Territorial Vegetarians</h2><p>Living primarily in grasslands, savannahs and tropical bush lands, ___ ___s are browsers with prehensile upper lips adapted for grasping and holding leaves and branches of shrubs and trees.</p><p>___ ___s are semi-social and territorial. Adult females have overlapping ranges while males are generally solitary and may be territorial. ___ ___ home ranges vary greatly depending on the habitat and to some extent on sex and age.</p><p>___ ___s may live up to 35 years in the wild. Females reach sexual maturity between ages 4 and 7; males mature between ages 7 and 10. Gestation lasts approximately 14-16 months, with a single calf being the norm every 2-1/2 to 3 years.</p><h2>Critically Endangered</h2><p>Millions of years ago, ___s could be found in North America and Europe as well as in Africa and Asia. There are five surviving ___ species, three of which are critically endangered. The ___ ___ and white ___ are found in Africa, while the greater one-horned ___, Sumatran ___, and Javan ___ call Asia home.</p><p>During the last century, the ___ ___ has suffered the most drastic decline in total numbers of all ___ species. Between 1970 and 1992, its population dropped by 96%. By 1993, only 2,300 individuals survived in the wild. The current population is estimated to be 5,055.</p><h3>Illegal Poaching</h3><p>The ___ ___ has been pushed to the brink of extinction by illegal poaching for their horns, and to a lesser extent by loss of habitat. A major market for these horns, Arab nations use them to make ornately carved handles for ceremonial daggers. The horn is also falsely believed to be medicine in many Asian cultures. ___ horn is made of keratin, which is the same protein that makes up hair and fingernails. With the growing purchasing power of many Asian countries and the existence of organized gangs of poachers, the threat to ___s remains great.<span style="font-size: 1.6rem;"> </span></p><img border="0" class="ccm-image-block" alt="" src="/files/4314/7449/2255/___-Poaching-Chart-2016.jpg" width="800" height="590" /><h3>Help for ___s</h3><p>In response, a group of concerned individuals and institutions founded the ___ ___ Foundation in 1989. In 1993, this foundation expanded its mission and became the <a href="http://www.___s.org/">International ___ Foundation</a>, which is dedicated to ___ conservation and research. Conservationists\' intensive anti-poaching efforts had encouraging results in the 1990s and 2000s and the number of ___ ___s in the wild began increasing very slowly. Unfortunately, there has been a resurgence of poaching in recent years and this activity is again posing a significant threat to wild ___ ___ populations. Current estimates show 5,055 individual ___ ___s are now alive - all precious representatives of the glorious history of the ___ family.</p><h2>Zoo Supports Conservation in the Wild</h2><p>The Saint Louis Zoo\'s WildCare Institute <a title="Conservation in the Horn of Africa" href="/conservation/wildcare-institute/conservationinthehornofafr/">Center for Conservation in the Horn of Africa</a> was established to provide<em> in situ</em> and <em>ex situ</em> conservation support for the wildlife of the Horn of Africa. This center\'s work in Kenya with the Northern Rangelands Trust benefits ___ ___s. In addition, each year the <a title="American Association of Zoo Keepers" href="/animals/soyouwanttobeazookeeper/americanassociationofzooke/">St. Louis Chapter of American Association of Zoo Keepers</a> (AAZK) sponsors Bowling for ___s, a fundraising bowl-a-thon which supports the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in Kenya, Ujung Kulon National Park in Java, Indonesia and Bukit Barisan Selatan and Way Kambas National Parks in Sumatra.</p><p>On March 11, 2016 a female ___ ___ in Sera Community ___ Sanctuary, Kenya, gave birth to a healthy calf, and made history. This is the first ___ ___ to be born on community land in northern Kenya for over 25 years, and demonstrates the strength of the growing community conservation movement. The calf also represents the community\'s hopes that the Sanctuary can nurture a viable breeding population of ___ ___; that could eventually help repopulate other community conservation areas. <a href="http://www.nrt-kenya.org/news-list/2016/3/21/press-release-sera-community-___-sanctuary-celebrate-first-___-___-birth">Read more</a>. The Zoo\'s WildCare Institute and AAZK have provided funding to the Sera Community ___ Sanctuary.</p><h2>At the Saint Louis Zoo</h2><p>Because of their endangered status, the Zoo\'s ___ ___s are part of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums\' ___ ___ Species Survival Plan (SSP), a program to manage a genetically healthy population of ___ ___s in North American zoos. Currently there are 60 ___ ___s in 26 institutions. In all, 10 ___ ___ calves have been born at the Saint Louis Zoo.</p><p>Ruka, the first ___ ___ to be born at the Saint Louis Zoo in 20 years was born January 14, 2011, to first-time parents, mother Kati Rain and father Ajabu. At age 4, Ruka moved to the Oregon Zoo to pair with a compatible female at the recommendation of the SSP. Ruka\'s parents live at River\'s Edge.</p><p>Male calf <a title="___ Calf" href="/animals/abouttheanimals/mammals/hoofedmammals/______/___calf/">Moyo</a> was born on May 17, 2017 to the same parents.

Male ___s can weigh more than 6,000 pounds. Females are more "delicate," topping out around 3,000 pounds. Despite their massive bulk, ___s can run faster than humans -- up to 30 miles per hour!</p><h2>Made for Water</h2><p>A ___s spends most of its life in the water, and its body is well-suited to a liquid lifestyle. Blubber makes the animal buoyant, so it can float. And its skin oozes a pink "slime" that protects the ___ from sunburn, both in and out of the water.</p><p>The ___\'s head is also well adapted for aquatic life. Its eyes sit on top of the head, so the ___ can get most of its body under water and still see what\'s going on above water. The nostrils are also located on top of the muzzle so the ___ can stay mostly under water and still breathe and sniff the air. When the ___ submerges, the nostrils close to keep out water.</p><p>The ears sit high on the head, so the ___ can still hear what\'s going on above water when it\'s mostly underneath. If the whole head goes under, the ears swivel to shake out water when the ___ resurfaces. But what about sounds <strong>below</strong> the water? That\'s a job for the ___\'s jawbone, which conducts sound waves. So a ___ with its jaw submerged can hear sounds above and below water at the same time!</p><p>And one more way a ___ is adapted for life in the water: it can hold its breath for up to five minutes.</p><h2>Hungry, Hungry ___s</h2><p>___s spend most of their days in or near the water in groups called pods. In the evenings, pods break up and the ___s leave the water, either singly or as females with their calves. They wander as much as three miles from the water in search of food.</p><p>___s spend most of the night eating grass. They use their wide mouth like a lawnmower, grazing the grass down to a few inches from the ground over a large area. A ___ can eat up to 90 pounds of grass in one night!</p><h2>Water Babies</h2><p>___ are so aquatic that females even give birth in the water! The babies, weighing 50 to 100 pounds, surface right after birth to take their first breath.</p><p>For the first year of their life, the youngsters nurse -- either under water or on land, depending on where mom is when they get hungry. After they\'re weaned, calves remain with their mothers until fully grown, at about eight years of age.</p><h2>Females, Bachelors, and Territorial Bulls</h2><p>Female ___s and their calves gather into groups during the day. But when they leave the water at night, groups breaks apart and each female goes off with her own calves to graze.</p><p>Most males hang out in bachelor groups. But a small percentage of males (about 10% of the population) are territorial. Each territorial bull defends his own stretch of land along the water\'s edge. Along with the real estate come exclusive mating rights to all females who live in his domain.</p><p>The territorial male will allow bachelor males to wander into his territory, providing they know who\'s boss and behave submissively. If a bachelor male challenges the territory holder, a bloody battle can break out. Dagger-sharp canines, up to 20 inches long, can seriously injure -- or even kill -- an opponent.</p><h2>Helpful ___s</h2><p>___s may not know it, but they help other animals that live in their habitat. As they walk from the water to their grazing grounds, ___s create well-worn paths. Other animals use these paths, too. And when ___s "mow" grass, they create ___ lawns. Other animals, like gazelles, benefit from the new green shoots that grow there.</p><p>When ___s return to the river, they help the fish who swim there. How? ___s defecate in the water, and their tail acts like a "manure spreader," shooting dung everywhere. Small fish, snails, and other little critters gobble up the nutrient-rich dung -- and are themselves eaten by larger fish. Downriver, people and other animals catch and eat the fish. They can thank a ___ for their food!</p><h2>What\'s Happening to ___s?</h2><p>___s are threatened in the wild. In the last 10 years, their numbers have declined by up to 20%, and it\'s estimated that as few as 125,000 ___s remain in Africa. More important than the total number of ___s, however, is their distribution. The Democratic Republic of the Congo and West African countries have seen the sharpest ___ declines; if the trend continues, the ___ could become extinct in these areas.</p><p>___s are hunted for their meat and for their canine teeth. There is an increasing demand for ___ teeth in the illegal ivory trade, due largely to the ban on elephant ivory. Many items that appear to be carved from small elephant tusks are in fact made from ___ canines.</p><p>Another problem is habitat loss. As people move into ___ habitat, they come into conflict with the animals, which raid their crops. Some of these ___s are shot and killed. Others escape wounded -- and dangerous. Rampaging ___s can attack and kill people on land or in the river.</p><p>What\'s being done to help ___s? Since 1995, the international trade in ___s and ___ products has been severely restricted. Nevertheless, poaching remains a serious problem. There is a need for long-term protection of national parks and other ___ habitats if these animals are to survive.</p><h2>Fun Facts</h2><ul><li>___s can\'t sweat, so staying in water helps them keep cool.</li><li>A ___\'s bellow can be louder than a heavy-metal band playing 15 feet away.</li><li>___ means "river horse" in Greek, but the animal is more closely related to the pig than the horse.</li></ul><p>Class: Mammalia<br />Order: Artiodactyla<br />Family: ___potamidae</p>        </section>',

In color, they\'re mostly brown to gray brown, with a darker stripe (bordered by white) that extends from the throat to the middle of the back.</p><h2>Dinner Time</h2><p>It\'s obvious that ___s like to eat...well, ants! But they also eat termites and the eggs and cocoons of these insects. Sometimes they broaden the menu, snacking on beetle larvae and fruits.</p><p>___ ___s sniff out their prey (since their eyesight is poor). They use their powerful front limbs and large claws to dig into termite and ant mounds. Then they use their long, sticky tongue to slurp up their food. Yum!</p><h2>Little ___s</h2><p>The season for ___ mating is fall. After a pregnancy of some six months, a female gives birth to a single baby in the spring or summer. The birth takes place in a sheltered place, like a thick clump of shrubs.</p><p>This newborn is no helpless baby! It has sharp claws, and can crawl onto its mom\'s back shortly after being born. The little ___ will nurse for about six months, but will stay with its mom for up to two years, until it\'s reached maturity.</p><h2>Going Solo</h2><p>Except for mother-baby groups, ___ ___s spend most of their time alone. They\'re active during the day (except in areas inhabited by people, where they\'re active at night). They spend a lot of time foraging for food on the ground, though they climb trees on occasion.</p><p>When they\'re not eating, they\'re usually relaxing. They rest for up to 15 hours a day (what a life!) in a shallow depression they scoop out of the ground. They cover their body with their bushy tail, which helps conceal them from predators.</p><h2>Attack of the ___ ___s</h2><p>___ ___s have only two natural predators -- pumas and jaguars. Sometimes the ___s try to outrun their attackers, but other times they fight. Rearing up on their hind legs, they slash at their foes with their sturdy forearms and sharp claws (which can be up to four inches long!). ___ ___s have also been known to grab an attacker, crushing it with their powerful front limbs. These are not ___s to be trifled with!</p><h2>Even ___s Need Help</h2><p>___ ___s are in danger of extinction in the wild. They\'ve disappeared from most of their historic range in Central America -- victims of habitat loss. In South America, these animals are often hunted as trophies or captured by animal dealers.</p><p>What can be done to help ___ ___s? One solution is to work with native communities, helping them learn how to live in harmony with these animals (see side story).

Both birds and current are named after the 18th-century explorer Alexander von ___.</p><h2>Black and White and Pink All Over</h2><p>___s are medium-sized ___s, averaging 28 inches long and weighing about 9 pounds. You can recognize them by the black band of feathers across their chest. Females are slightly smaller than males, but otherwise look very similar.</p><p>___s have added another color to the plain black and white of other ___s: pink! They have splotchy pink patches on their face and feet, as well as the underside of their wings. Actually, the pink doesn\'t come from their feathers: it\'s the result of bare skin patches, an adaptation that helps keep the birds cool in a warmer climate (see <strong>Fun Facts</strong>).</p><p>___s\' torpedo-shaped bodies are designed for moving efficiently through water. ___s can reach speeds of 30 miles per hour. They use their wings to help them swim, and their webbed feet to steer underwater. Their bones tend to be denser than those of flying birds, since the extra weight helps them dive to greater depths.</p><h2>Fish on the Menu</h2><p>If you don\'t like eating fish, you wouldn\'t like being a ___ ___! Their favorite food is anchovetta, small fish that thrive in the cold waters off the South American coast. Unfortunately, humans also fish for anchovetta, which they harvest to make bone meal for animal feed. So ___s suffer from the competition posed by the numerous fishing boats that visit their home waters.</p><p>___s also eat squid and crustaceans (like shrimp and krill). They don\'t have to drink water, since they take in seawater as they swallow their prey. But like all ___s, they have a special gland that removes salt from their bodies after they swallow saltwater.</p><h2>To See in the Sea</h2><p>The underwater world requires different eyesight than the one we\'re used to. So ___ eyes are sensitive to the colors of the sea -- violets, blues, and greens. Their eyes also have a second transparent eyelid, serving as "goggles" while the animal is underwater.</p><h2>They Nest in <em>What</em>?</h2><p>___s ___s have developed a unique place to lay their eggs - - they dig them into the layers of dried guano (poop) left from seabirds! (Because of the dry climate, guano from generations of birds can build up many feet deep.) Sometimes they also nest in rocky crevices.</p><p>The birds breed throughout the year, though breeding seems to depend on the availability of food and nesting sites. The male arrives at a site a few days before the female and prepares the nest burrow. He uses his wings and feet to push and mold the guano into the shape he wants, then gathers soil, rocks, and sometimes grasses to finish it off.</p><p>After mating, the female lays two white eggs. Both parents take turns sitting on the eggs until they hatch, usually in about 39 days. The pair also works together to feed the chicks.</p><p>Sadly, the breeding habits of the ___ ___ are being disrupted by human activity. Because guano has value as a fertilizer, miners in South America harvest it down to the bare rock, leaving many coastal areas scraped clean. ___s are left with nothing to burrow into, so they hatch far fewer babies.</p><h2>An Uncertain Life</h2><p>It\'s not easy being a ___ ___: the birds face a number of natural and man-made hazards. In the ocean, leopard seals, fur seals, sea lions, sharks, and killer whales all prey on ___s. On land, their eggs and chicks can fall victim to foxes, snakes, and introduced predators like cats and dogs.</p><p>Weather conditions also pose problems. When the El Nino climatic effect raises the temperature of the sea, it reduces the ___s\' food supply.</p><p>___ ___s also face a number of threats from humans, due in large part to the productive areas they inhabit. Commercial fishermen are attracted to the highly fertile Pacific waters off South America, where rich nutrients support large fish populations. Their activities not only deplete the ___s\' food source, but also kill large numbers of ___s that become entangled in fishing nets.</p><p>Humans also hunt ___s for food, and take eggs from breeding sites. Add to that the effects of guano harvesting, and there\'s little wonder these ___s are in trouble.</p><h2>Hope for ___s</h2><p>While the numbers of ___ ___s have been declining since the mid-19th century, many people are working to reverse that trend.</p><p>Since 1995, Chile has had a 30-year ban on the hunting and capture of ___s, and four of the major breeding colonies are protected. ___s in Peru have benefited from guano reserves, where the birds can make their nests. Guano mining in the reserves is limited, and those who do mine must sign a contract to protect the ___s. The Saint Louis Zoo has sent staff to help monitor the mining in the reserves, and is taking other conservation efforts to save these birds (see side story).</p><h2>Fun Facts</h2><ul><li>Did you know ___ ___s can blush? When they get too hot (it can get up to 108 degrees (F) where they live) they have to avoid over-heating. So they flush pink on their face, wings and feet. This sheds body heat by sending blood to the bare part of their bodies.</li><li>Throughout the day, ___s engage in a vital activity: they preen their feathers. They gather oil from their preening gland and apply it to their feathers and the edges of the flippers. This keeps their feathers waterproof, helping insulate the birds from the cold.</li><li>Like all ___s, a ___\'s black and white color helps camouflage it when it\'s in the sea. When seen from below, its white belly blends with the light cast on the ocean surface; and when seen from above, its black back blends with the darkness of the ocean depths.</li></ul><p>Class: Aves<br />Order: Sphenisciformes<br />Family: Spheniscidae</p>        </section>',

Its body is extremely slender, its head small, its bill strangely curved and hooked. And then there\'s the matter of color –) how many animals can you name that are <strong>HOT PINK</strong>?</p><h2>They Are What They Eat</h2><p>___s owe their peculiar looks to their feeding habits. Their elongated body, neck and legs allow them to wade into much deeper water than most shore birds, thereby expanding their food choices. (They can even swim, if necessary.)</p><p>___s use their webbed feet to stir up the mud, then plunge their long bill upside down underwater. With a unique pumping action of their piston-like tongue, they suck up a variety of small animals, including small shrimp and other crustaceans, mollusks, invertebrates like insects and larvae, and blue-green algae. Their upper and lower jaws have ridged edges that serve as a filter, straining out water and mud at the sides of the bill, so the bird swallows little except its prey. (Baleen whales filter feed like this, too, though without the sucking tongue and long bill!)</p><p>Even the ___s\' notoriously-colored plumage is a result of their diet. Their brilliant red, hot pinks, corals and oranges come from the <strong>carotenoid</strong> pigments in the algae and in some of the crustaceans that the birds eat (similar to the pigment in carrots).</p><h2>An Ocean of Pink</h2><p>___s are social birds. They live in large groups, sometimes up to tens of thousands of birds, an undulating ocean of pink. The sound of a large ___ flock is also impressive (they\'re often mistaken for geese) and can be heard a great distance away. The birds are very vocal and use a wide variety of honks, alarm calls and other vocalizations.</p><p>___s in a colony feed together, breed together, and fly together. They eat by day, but when a feeding area no longer provides enough food for the flock, the birds move to another location at night.</p><p>The birds are quite distinctive looking in flight. They stretch out their long necks and legs and spread their wings so the black undersides are visible. A ___\'s wingspan can range from three to five feet, depending on the size of the bird.</p><h2>Group Love</h2><p>Within a colony, ___s breed in pairs, usually all at about the same time. Pair bonds are not strong, and pairs may change from one season to the next.</p><p>Scientists think ___s need a "critical mass" of birds to initiate breeding and that smaller flocks tend not to breed as well as larger ones. Breeding season is quite a sight, with large numbers of ___s engaged in elaborate courtship displays -- including marching, head turning (known as <strong>flagging</strong>), calling and preening. This simultaneous breeding assures that most of the birds in the colony lay their eggs and raise their young at the same time.</p><p>Once a pair of ___s breeds, both male and female help build a nest. A ___ nest is simple –) basically just a mound of mud about a foot high. The mound serves to protect the egg and chick from floods and ground heat. The female lays a single, large egg. Both parents take turns sitting on the nest (folding their legs beneath them) until the chick hatches.</p><h2>Bringing Up Baby</h2><p>A Caribbean ___ hatchling is gray-white, and for the first month or so its bill is straight, not curved like an adult bill. The chick stays in the nest for up to two weeks. During this time, both parents take turns feeding it a type of \"milk\" called <strong>crop milk</strong>, which comes from the parents\' digestive tract. The chick\'s begging seems to stimulate production of this milk, either in its parents or in other adult foster-feeders. (Many pigeon species also produce crop milk.)</p><p>After two weeks, ___ chicks join other chicks in the colony to form a large nursery <strong>creche</strong>, supervised by the parents. The creche in some species can contain as many as 30,000 birds, yet parents seem to have a remarkable ability to find their chick in the creche, recognizing it by its calls.</p><p>Chicks can feed themselves at four to six weeks old, but parents continue feeding them until they fledge.</p><h2>Fun Facts</h2><ul><li>There are six species of ___s. The Caribbean –) a subspecies of the greater ___ -- is the most brightly colored and the most widely distributed.</li><li>By eating blue-green algae, ___s help control the algae level in many wetlands.</li><li>The only obvious difference between the sexes is size –) the male ___ is somewhat larger than the female.</li><li>It\'s not a myth –) ___s actually DO stand on one leg.

This tree-living lifestyle is where the species received their name. “___,” of Malaysian origin means “person of the forest.” It is a fitting name for this aps so well adapted to a life in the trees that is essentially has four hands (their feet are just like hands) to climb through the canopy of the forest. The ___ rarely leaves the trees, even making nests in the branches of the trees to sleep in at night or nap in during the day.</p><p>Note: There are two distinct species of ___s: the Bornean ___, Pongo pygmaeus, and the Sumatran ___, Pongo abelii. The latter is the one you can see at the Saint Louis Zoo. Although their habits are almost identical, the two species live on separate islands in the South Pacific.</p></div>    </li>      <li>      <input type="radio" name="accordion-26746" id="toggle-26746-2" >      <label for="toggle-26746-2"><span>Big Red</span></label>      <div><p>___s’ unique bright red hair makes these large apes easy to recognize. But the two sexes are also easy to distinguish from one another. Male ___s are about twice the size of females, weighing up to 300 pounds and reaching a height of five feet. Not only are the males much larger, but they also develop a throat pouch and prominent cheek pads when sexually mature, about 15 years old.</p><p>Thanks to some pretty distinctive physical adaptations, ___s are the only apes that live primarily in trees. (While <a title="___anzee" href="https://www.stlzoo.org/animals/abouttheanimals/mammals/lemursmonkeysapes/___anzee/">___anzees</a>, bonobos and <a title="Western Lowland Gorilla" href="https://www.stlzoo.org/animals/abouttheanimals/mammals/lemursmonkeysapes/westernlowlandgorilla/">western lowland gorillas</a> can climb and nest in trees, they spend most of their lives on the ground.) ___s’ feet are so well adapted for grasping tree branches, for instance, that they cannot place them flat on the ground. Instead, they have to walk on the outside of the curved foot (called "fist-walking").</p><p>In addition, they have extremely long arms for reaching, slender hands with short thumbs and long fingers for hooking over branches, and flexible hips for holding on in any direction. Plus, ___s have tremendous strength. This enables them to swing from branch to branch and to hang upside-down for long periods of time to retrieve food.</p><p>These traits make it possible for ___s to perform almost all of their necessary behaviors while suspended in the trees – including feeding, traveling, mating, nesting and child rearing. However, these apes move so awkwardly on the ground that they’re essentially unable to live anywhere else but in the forest canopy.</p></div>    </li>      <li>      <input type="radio" name="accordion-26746" id="toggle-26746-3" >      <label for="toggle-26746-3"><span>A Passion for Fruit</span></label>      <div><p>By far the favorite food of wild ___s is fruit and it usually makes up about 60% of their diet. They have been observed eating more than 300 kinds of fruit, the two most common of which are figs and durian. When fruit is unavailable, they also eat leaves, stems, tree bark, and insects such as ants and termites.</p><p>Knowing what kinds of food to eat and not to eat is not a simple matter in tropical forests. ___s need to know hundreds of species of plants and trees, which fruits are edible, and how to get at tasty food that’s covered by sharp spines or shells. Babies rely on their mothers to teach them these skills, as well as where to find food, in which trees, and during which seasons. A successful ___ is thought to have a very detailed mental “map” of the forest in his or her mind, including knowledge of the fruiting cycles of many species of trees.</p><p>Because trees produce fruit only seasonally, this food source tends to be irregular and widely distributed. Although ___s have an uncanny ability to remember from year to year which trees fruit and when, they’re still limited by the patchy supply (and their slow speed). That means foraging is highly competitive, and any one area can’t support many ___s. Hence the reason these apes are solitary.</p></div>    </li>      <li>      <input type="radio" name="accordion-26746" id="toggle-26746-4" >      <label for="toggle-26746-4"><span>Stocking the Toolbox</span></label>      <div><p>Many wild ___s have developed an amazing ability to use tools to help them exploit what food they can find. They’ve been observed using probes like twigs to extract insects and honey from tree trunks (held in their hands or their teeth), as well as blunt tools to scrape seeds from spiny fruit cases.</p><p>In addition to food-gathering tools, wild ___s have been observed making tools to scratch themselves, fashioning leafy branches into “umbrellas” to shelter themselves from sun and rain, and using branches as swatters to repel bees or wasps that are attacking. Many have also been seen using “leaf gloves” to handle prickly fruits or branches, or creating “seat cushions” to sit comfortably in thorny trees.</p><p>Tool use hasn’t been observed in all ___ populations, and it shows great variations even when it exists. This suggests to scientists that tool use is the result of innovation and learning that’s passed on from one generation to the next – one of the hallmarks of culture.</p></div>    </li>      <li>      <input type="radio" name="accordion-26746" id="toggle-26746-5" >      <label for="toggle-26746-5"><span>A Long Childhood</span></label>      <div><p>Except for humans, ___s have the longest childhood of any animal in the world. Babies of more social ape species can learn from multiple adults, ___ babies depend on just one adult -- their mother. Female ___s usually mature around 12 or 13 years, giving birth around the age of 15. The mother ___ will carry her baby around with her for the first year. Around two or three years old, the baby ___ will start to stray form the mother, but never more than a few feet away and will return to the mother often. For the next several years, the ___ baby will learn from its mother how to find food, make a nest, and use tools. Once the mother ___ has a new baby, the young ___ will start to learn to live apart from its mother, although returning frequently.</p><p>___s have one of the longest periods of time between births of any terrestrial mammal, with female ___s having a baby approximately every nine years and the pregnancy lasting approximately eight months and twenty days. This low reproductive rate of ___s is another limiting factor in their survival in the wild.</p><p>Baby ___s nurse until they are about six years of age, slowly learning how to eat fruit and other solid food as they travel through the forest with their mother. Even after weaning, a young male often stays close by his mother for a few more years. Eventually, males become usually nomadic, often traveling great distances from their home region. "Long-calls" and loud roars enable them to maintain their distance from one another in the forest.</p><p>Young females, however, may stay near their mother until they are into their teens. This allows them to observe parenting skills as they watch their mother care for a younger sibling. Males are not successful in attracting sexually receptive females until they get their cheek pads, also as teenagers.</p><p>___s normally live about 35 to 40 years in the wild; in captivity they’ve been known to live into their 50s.</p></div>    </li>      <li>      <input type="radio" name="accordion-26746" id="toggle-26746-6" >      <label for="toggle-26746-6"><span>A Solitary Life</span></label>      <div><p><span style="font-size: 1.6rem;">Wild ___s generally live alone (see A Passion for Fruit above), a byproduct of their food preferences. The only long-term bond they have is between a female and her young. When ___s do encounter one another, they are normally very tolerant and non-aggressive, unless the encounter is between two mature males.</span></p><p>A male in control of a home range that includes several females often won\'t tolerate the intrusion of other males. Fights occasionally break out. One male usually charges another, breaking branches and threatening his rival. If that doesn’t scare him off, the two might grapple and bite each other until one backs down.</p></div>    </li>      <li>      <input type="radio" name="accordion-26746" id="toggle-26746-7" >      <label for="toggle-26746-7"><span>A Species on the Brink</span></label>      <div><p>About 10,000 years ago, ___s were found throughout Southeast Asia, even in southern China.

Today, however, only 10,000-25,000 still survive in the tropical forests of Borneo and Sumatra.</p><p>Both Bornean and Sumatran ___s have been in dire trouble for some time. The primary reasons are habitat loss and degradation from logging, forest fires, and timber clearing for farming (including palm oil plantations) and human settlements. ___s are also hunted and killed for their meat (bushmeat), and young apes are captured for sale in the illegal pet trade.</p><p>Sumatran ___s could be extinct in the wild in as little as five years.</p></div>    </li>      <li>      <input type="radio" name="accordion-26746" id="toggle-26746-8" >      <label for="toggle-26746-8"><span>To the Rescue</span></label>      <div><p>So what can be done to help Sumatran ___s?

Yet another problem is the ebola virus, which is killing huge numbers of ___s.</p><p>While habitat loss, capture, and ebola are continuing problems for ___s, an even bigger crisis has emerged in recent years. It\'s called the bushmeat trade. ___s (and other mammals) are being killed for their meat at a rate faster than they can reproduce. In some cases, the hunters are poor people who need protein to survive.

Our founding fathers chose it as a symbol of strength, long life and majestic looks, and also because it is the only ___ unique to North America. Legend also has it that, during a morning battle early in the American Revolutionary War, a group of ___ ___s circled over the heads of the patriots as they fought.</p><p>The ___ appears in the Great Seal of the United States, in the seals of many of our individual states, and on most American coins.</p><h2>A ___-faced Lie</h2><p>The ___ ___ is not really ___. It carries that name because, when seen from a distance, its white head- and neck-feathers tend to make the bird appear ___.</p><p>This bird reaches an impressive size. From head to tail it can measure up to three-and-a-half-feet long, and weigh between eight and 15 pounds. The wingspan of an adult can reach eight feet.</p><p>Adult male and female ___ ___s look the same, with the characteristic white head, white tail markings, and brown body. Their beak, feet and eyes are yellow. Young ___s are a mottled brown color. It takes juveniles four to five years to develop their adult plumage.</p><h2>Something Fishy</h2><p>___ ___s are strictly meat-eaters, and are efficient hunters. Their sharp claws (called talons) not only help them latch onto their prey, but often deliver a fatal blow. Then the birds use their beak to tear their food into bite-size pieces.</p><p>Their primary source of food is fish (often salmon) -- which can comprise 60 to 90 percent of their diet. (The ___s\' preference for fish was unfortunately the cause of the birds\' serious decline in the mid-20th century -- see "Conservation Success Story," below.) They also eat small birds, mammals (rabbits, muskrats), the occasional turtle, and carrion (animal carcass) if they come across it. ___s have even been observed stealing fish from ospreys and other birds.</p><p>___s usually hunt by themselves. But in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest, large colonies of ___ ___s gather along the rivers when the salmon are running. They perch in trees and on riverbanks, waiting to swoop down on tired and weakened fish.</p><h2>___ Eye</h2><p>Like most birds, ___ ___s rely primarily on their keen sense of sight. Scientists have found their eyesight is six times sharper than that of humans.</p><p>Some ___s have been known to spot fish at distances up to one mile. No wonder someone with good eyesight is known as an "___ eye!"</p><h2>The Ultimate Sibling Rivalry</h2><p>___ ___s often mate for life. Courting behavior begins in early April, and often involves spectacular aerial displays in which the birds dive through the sky and sometimes lock their talons together. </p><p>After mating, the birds nest in the tops of tall trees, sometimes more than 100 feet above the ground. The male and female enlarge the nest every year with sticks, leaves, grasses, and feathers -- so much so that it can reach a massive size. The largest ___ ___ nest on record was 20 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and two tons in weight!</p><p>The female usually lays two white eggs a day or two apart. Both parents take turns sitting on the clutch. When the chicks hatch, the stronger of the two babies often picks on the weaker one -- sometimes killing it, sometimes starving it to death by stealing its food.</p><h2>A Southern "Vacation"</h2><p>Adult ___ ___s try to stay close to their nesting territory, as long as there is enough food and running water. But as winter sets in, many of them migrate south to the southern parts of North America and to Mexico. An ___ usually migrates to the same location every year, but returns in the spring to its original nesting grounds.</p><p>___s are able to migrate long distance because they make use of rising currents of warm air known as thermals. By gliding from thermal to thermal, they can soar for long periods of time with little need to flap their wings, thus conserving energy.</p><p>While ___ ___s are solitary on their breeding grounds, they\'re more sociable during migration and during their winter "vacation." They can often be seen in large numbers roosting and hunting along rivers and streams.</p><h2>Conservation Success Story</h2><p>The ___ is one of America\'s best-known conservation successes, and its future now looks bright. But not so long ago the ___ ___ was close to extinction. </p><p>A variety of factors caused the species\' downfall. After World War II, there was widespread use of insecticides like DDT. These toxins drained into rivers from farmlands, accumulating in fish and other river animals. When the ___s ate the fish, the pesticides caused them to lay eggs whose shells were too thin to support the weight of brooding parents. The ___s\' birth rate crashed.</p><p>Other trends worsened the situation. The ___s\' habitat was severely reduced as farmers and developers drained swamps and other wetlands. Hunters, including ranchers intent on protecting their sheep, also took their toll. By 1963, there were only 417 known breeding pairs of ___ ___s in the lower 48 states. In Missouri, all of the nesting ___ ___s had disappeared. Eventually, the bird was declared endangered in 43 states and threatened in five others.</p><p>Then the tide turned. In 1967, the ___ ___ was officially declared an endangered species (under a law that preceded the Endangered Species Act). A ban on DDT -- together with wetland restoration projects and bans on the hunting of ___ ___s -- helped the birds make a slow comeback. By the mid-1990s, they had made such a significant recovery that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service upgraded their federal status in the lower 48 states to threatened. "IUCN" now lists the species as common.</p><p>Further recognition of the ___s\' success was the recent announcement by federal officials that the ___ ___ will soon be taken off the threatened species list. The birds will continue to be protected under the federal ___ ___ Protection Act of 1940, which prohibits killing or selling the bird.</p><p>___ ___s have begun to breed once again in Missouri -- home to the largest wintering population of the birds in the lower 48 states. Today, Missouri once again provides a summer home for nesting ___ ___s and a wintering habitat for thousands more. </p><h2>Fun Facts</h2><ul><li>A ___ ___ can live up to 30 years in the wild, and longer in captivity.</li><li>These ___s can fly up to 60 miles per hour, and can dive at speeds up to 100 miles per hour.</li><li>All ___ ___s in captivity -- including those at the Saint Louis Zoo -- can no longer survive in the wild. They have all been injured, often by human activities.</li></ul>        </section>',

The litter can include as many as five babies, but the average is two or three.</p><p>The kittens are very active by three months, but they may stay with their mom for one-and-a-half to almost two years.</p><h2>Going Solo</h2><p>___ ___s are solitary, spending most of their time alone. The only exceptions are moms caring for their dependent offspring, and males and females pairing up for mating season.</p><p>So how do males and females find each other when they\'re ready to mate? As the cats travel, they mark their path with feces and urine. These aromas carry important information about the cats\' identity, gender, readiness to breed, and the time the scent-marks were made.</p><h2>Saving ___ ___s</h2><p>Wild ___ ___s are in serious trouble.

And when the cats turn to domestic livestock for food, they\'re often shot by ranchers.</p><p>So what\'s being done to save these animals? For one thing, an international agreement bans the trade in ___ ___s or their products. Unfortunately, the protection is not always enforced. More important for ___ ___s\' survival, perhaps, is a network of protected areas in the mountains of central Asia.</p><p>There are also conservation organizations, such as the <a href="http://www.______.org" target="_blank">___ ___ Trust</a>, which are working to save these animals.</p><p>What can <strong>you</strong> do to help ___ ___s?

With legs like that, it\'s no surprise these animals are closely related to zebras.</p><p>Like all African ___ ___es, the ___ subspecies has long, narrow hooves -- the narrowest of any equid. This unique design allows the animals to be swift and surefooted in their rough, rocky habitat.</p><h2>This ___ Eats Gr___</h2><p>Gr___ is the favored food of ___ ___ ___es, but they also eat shrubs and other desert plants. Like many other grazing animals, they first grasp a plant with their strong lips, pull it into their mouth, and then tear it off with their teeth. The teeth are large and have flat surfaces -- perfect for tearing and chewing even the toughest plants.</p><p>These animals graze mostly when it\'s cooler -- at dawn, dusk, and during the night. During the heat of the day, they often retreat to rocky hills to rest in shady spots.</p><p>Given their hot environment, it\'s no surprise that ___ ___ ___es stay within easy reach of water: they generally don\'t wander more than 20 miles from a drinking source. They can go without water longer than other equids, but they still need to drink at least once every two or three days.</p><h2>Foaling Around</h2><p>By the time a male ___ ___ ___ has reached his second year, he is capable of breeding. However, because he has to compete with older, stronger males, he\'s unlikely to mate before he\'s four years old. Females, on the other hand, generally begin breeding at the ripe old age of two.</p><p>Pregnancy lasts for about one year, after which a female gives birth to (usually) a single foal. Though the female is capable of having a new baby every year, it\'s more likely that she\'ll breed once every two years.</p><h2>To Group or Not To Group</h2><p>Mothers can always be found with their dependent foals, but otherwise there are no predictable groupings of ___ ___ ___es. Some animals (usually males) are solitary, living alone for periods of time. Others live in herds (all-male, mares and foals, or mixed herds), which can have up to 50 members. But these groups are flexible, and animals change herds frequently.</p><p>Some stallions defend territories, often around water supplies. A territory covers about nine square miles, on average. Within his home turf, the dominant stallion will tolerate males of lower status -- as long as they recognize his superiority!</p><h2>Equids in Danger</h2><p>All subspecies of the African ___ ___ (including the ___ ___ ___) are critically endangered. This means they face an extremely high risk of extinction in the ___.</p><p>___ populations have declined for a number of reasons. For one thing, some local people have been known to hunt the ___es for food and for use in traditional medicine. (Some native people believe the animals\' fat is an effective treatment for tuberculosis.) Hunting has taken a greater toll in recent years, as political unrest in the area has allowed better access to automatic weapons.</p><p>African ___ ___es face other problems, brought about by increasing human populations and the expansion of agriculture. More and more, ___ ___es are competing with domestic livestock for limited grazing grounds and water sources. And as the ___ and domestic animals come into contact, there is more and more interbreeding -- another serious threat to ___ ___es.</p><p>African ___ ___es need help if they\'re going to survive in the ___. An essential first step is surveying the ___ populations to learn their numbers and distribution. This work is beginning now, through a partnership between the Ethiopian ___life Conservation Organization and the Saint Louis Zoo (see side story). These surveys will enable the researchers to develop detailed conservation strategies. Through these efforts, we hope to help African ___ ___es survive where they belong -- in the ___.</p><h2>Fun Facts</h2><ul><li>They may be small, but they\'re fast: African ___ ___es have been clocked at 30 miles per hour.</li><li>In the 16th century, the Spanish brought domesticated African ___ ___es to the southwestern United States. The descendants of those animals -- best known as burros -- still roam through the Southwest.</li></ul><p>Cl___: Mammalia<br />Order: Perissodactyla<br />Family: Equidae</p>        </section>',

To see this small, sparsely-haired pig is to realize this immediately. The ___ is not just another pretty face-but it is an unforgettable one!</p><p>In 1990, the Saint Louis Zoo acquired a pair of these elusive forest-dwellers through a complex cooperative loan program. A two-and-a-half year old male born at the Bronx Zoo was traded to the Los Angeles Zoo but flown to St. Louis on breeding loan. Los Angeles then sent a replacement male to the Bronx Zoo. An unrelated female ___ was then selected from the Los Angeles Zoo herd to pair with the new St. Louis resident. The net result was a breeding pair of ___ owned by the Los Angeles Zoo but managed by the Saint Louis Zoo. Since this time, the Saint Louis Zoo has raised five litters of nine piglets.</p><p>Little is known about the natural history of the ___ due to the difficulty of observing it in its thick jungle habitat. This shy pig lives in groups of five to fifteen animals in swamps and forests along rivers and lakes. The ___\'s coloration, torpedo-shaped body and deer-like movements enable it to melt silently into surrounding cover at the slightest disturbance.</p><h2>About That face</h2><p>The most striking feature of a ___ is its face. Besides being armed with a pair of slashing lower tusks, an impressive pair of upper tusks erupt through the top of the snout and curve back toward the eyes. These upper canines resemble antlers more than they do tusks. Not surprisingly, the translation of "babi-rusa" is "pig-deer."</p><p>There has been much debate over the purpose of the upper tusks on males. Sulawesi natives are convinced that these tusks hook over low-hanging branches to support the ___\'s head as it rests. A more plausible explanation was proposed by John McKinnon in 1981. His studies suggest that males developed this extraordinary set of upper tusks to protect the eyes and throat from the slashing lower tusks of competing males. This alternative use of the tusks was made possible by the fact that when the ___\'s ancestors arrived on Sulawesi they faced a predator-free environment. Without strong selection pressure to develop and maintain anti-predator mechanisms, the tusks were suddenly "free" to be modified for other uses. The greatest physical threat to the ancestral ___ boars was no longer predation, but competition. Rival boars armed with dagger-like tusks and surly dispositions posed a serious hazard to the average ___ boar come-a\'courtin.</p><p>Like all other pig species, ___ practice a social system in which males fight with other males over the right to breed several females. Violent struggles can occur involving the use of the sharp lower tusks. The frequency of these conflicts, and the inherent risk of serious injury, probably increased dramatically when the ___\'s ancestors first arrived from the mainland to this small, isolated island. This created a new selection measure that favored the development of mechanisms to reduce the risk of injury during the ritual combat between males.</p><p>The result of this selection pressure was the modification of the ___ boars\' upper tusks. Instead of curving down like other pigs\' tusks, they grew straight up through the snout, curving into a spiral that is ideal for catching and deflecting potential blows. Their placement at the top of the snout gives them added protection to the vulnerable eyes. These tusks have evolved to such a degree that boars seem to sprout veritable arsenals!</p><p>It should be noted that ___ females have remarkably reduced tusks relative to those of other suid females. This is probably a direct consequence of the lack of predators on the island, coupled with the fact that, in general, sows do not compete with each other in the way that boars do.</p><h2>About Its Family Tree</h2><p>While some paleontologic evidence suggests that ___ may be more closely related to ___s and peccaries than to true pigs, the species is currently classified as a suid (a member of the pig family). It is different enough, however, to warrant its own sub-family: Babyrusinae. Most of these differences can be traced to the ___\'s ancient origins. A primitive European pig, extinct for about 35 million years, is its closest relative.</p><p>The ___ is one of about a dozen species of wild pigs scattered across Africa, Europe, Asia and the surrounding islands. By introduction, wild boar and feral swine have been established in North and South America as well as Australia -- often with disastrous results. The snout, typical of wild pigs, allows these animals to rapidly turn over leaf litter and top soil, in search of dietary staples such as roots, grubs and tender new vegetation. Environmentalists in some of these regions refer to these introduced pests as "living rototillers" because of the damage they cause to fragile forest ecosystems unsuitable for sustaining wild pig populations.</p><h2>The Case for ___</h2><p>As a rule, the pig family represents a unique evolutionary direction for the ungulates (hoofed mammals). Pigs are the only ungulates that build nests and give birth to litters. In general, offspring are striped at birth and are much more altricial (dependent on parental care) than other ungulate offspring. Suids have very simple gastro-intestinal tracts compared to other hoofed mammals, and therefore tend to select diets of low-fiber, nutrient-dense foods such as fruits, seeds, shoots, roots and even carrion.</p><p>___ are the exception to many of these "pig rules." Their litter size is generally small; usually only numbering one to three unstriped offspring per litter. This reduced reproductive rate is thought to be a direct result of this species\' predator-free environment. ___ piglets are somewhat more precocial than those of other suids: typically they wander from the nest and sample solid foods by ten days of age. ___ also have a more complex two-chambered stomach, an indication that a species is capable of digesting fiber through the use of microbial fermentation similar to cattle, goats and sheep. Further, unlike other pig species, they have little or no hair on their drab brown bodies.</p><p>These animals are declining in the wild due to habitat destruction and over-hunting. In 1978, a population survey estimated that fewer than 4,000 ___ remained on Sulawesi, the nearby Togian Islands, Sula and Buru. In 1989, the Pigs and Peccaries Specialist Group of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), rated the ___ as the Asian pig species in greatest need of immediate conservation measures. Part of that conservation program includes an ex situ propagation effort to sustain a safety-net population in zoos in case the wild population continues to decline or goes extinct. The Saint Louis Zoo feels it can make a meaningful contribution to this effort.</p>        </section>',

The Speke\'s ___\'s "schnozz" actually has an important purpose: it is partly responsible for the animal\'s loud alarm call. By inflating the loose skin on the top of its muzzle, the ___ can increase the volume of its call, which resembles a honking sound.</p><h2>Small in Size</h2><p>These are among the smallest ___s, reaching a maximum shoulder height of only about two feet. Males weigh up to 40 pounds, while females range from 24 to 35 pounds.</p><p>Male and female Speke\'s ___s have a tan back, accented by a white underside and rump, and dark bands on the side. Both sexes have S-shaped horns with upward-curving tips. The horns of the males are noticeably larger and broader than those of the females.</p><h2>A Taste for Plants</h2><p>Speke\'s ___s graze on grass, herbs, shrubs and other plants. They can often survive a long time without water -- a useful adaptation in their dry habitat.</p><p>In recent years, these animals have found themselves competing for food with domestic livestock. So far, they have managed to find enough to eat on ranchland that is only moderately grazed.</p><h2>An Active Social Life</h2><p>Speke\'s ___s are social animals. They live in herds of five to 12 animals. When food is scarce, these smaller groups may merge into herds of up to 20 animals.</p><p>There are two typical kinds of herds. One is composed of an adult male with his harem of females, with which he breeds. The females determine the direction in which the herd grazes. But the dominant male works hard to keep his harem within the boundaries of his home range, an area of 1/2 to 2 square miles.</p><p>A second type of herd is the bachelor herd, made up of juvenile males and young adult males that don\'t have harems.</p><p>___ calves are born after a gestation period (pregnancy) of six months. They weigh 2 1/2 - 3 1/2 pounds at birth. Their mothers wean them after two to three months.</p><h2>Out of Harm\'s Way</h2><p>There are a host of predators that young ___s have to avoid, including cheetahs, lions, wild dogs, leopards, hyenas, and even pythons. So newborn babies lie motionless in the bush, emerging from hiding only long enough to nurse.</p><p>Even adult Speke\'s ___s rest during the heat of the day, as is the case with many hot-climate animals. They are active mainly in the early morning and evening.</p><h2>Trying to Compete with Livestock</h2><p>Speke\'s ___s used to range in large numbers through parts of Somalia and Ethiopia. In fact, in the 1980\'s, they were one of the most widespread and abundant of the Somali ___s. But now they have become extinct or severely reduced over a large part of their original range.</p><p>The main reason for their decline is the loss of grazing land to livestock. Their dry grasslands will support only so many grazing animals, and the ___s often lose out to cattle, goats and other domestic animals. Add to this the pressures of hunting and drought, and it\'s no wonder these little animals are in trouble.</p><p>There are currently no protected areas within the range of Speke\'s ___s. The conservation status of this species is expected to decline further in the absence of protection and management of wild populations and their habitat.</p><h2>Fun Facts</h2><ul><li>When they are excited or alarmed, Speke\'s ___s use a "pronk" behavior, a combination of running, bouncing, and jumping.</li><li>Speke\'s ___s live up to 12 years in the wild.</li></ul><p>Class: Mammalia<br />Order: Artiodactyla<br />Family: Bovidae</p>        </section>',

You might think its neck has a lot of bones, but in reality it has just seven - the same as most other mammals. The ___\'s neck bones just happen to be much longer!</p><h2>World Record Holder</h2><p>The ___ is the tallest living land animal. Males can reach a height of 16 to 18 feet while females are somewhat smaller at 14 to 16 feet.</p><p>___s are known for their spotted coats. Different subspecies (types) of ___s have different patterns of spots. Reticulated ___s (the kind we have at the Saint Louis Zoo) have large brown spots separated by cream-colored lines. Males are darker than females.</p><h2>Treetop Treats</h2><p>These animals have no competition when it comes to finding food. Their long neck helps them browse in a place that other animals can\'t reach: the treetops. Trees - including acacia, mimosa, and wild apricot - provide ___s\' favorite foods: leaves, fruits, and seedpods. ___s spend many hours each day feasting on treetop treats.</p><p>Since leaves provide a lot of moisture, ___s don\'t need to drink very often. They can go without water for many weeks, even months, at a time. Lucky thing - ever see a ___ drink from a pond? They have to spread their legs very, very wide to stoop low enough to drink!</p><h2>Sharp Senses</h2><p>___s have extremely keen eyesight and can see great distances: they can spot a moving person a mile away! They also have excellent hearing. These sharp senses help ___s stay alert for predators - like lions!</p><h2>Gentle Giants (and Their Babies)</h2><p>Males will spar, gently, for the attention of a potential mate. These sparring matches are called "neck-knocking" because - you guessed it! - they knock necks. The males rarely bite or kick during these bouts, and injuries are rare.</p><p>After a male and female pair up and mate, they have a while to wait for the birth of their baby: about 15 months! There is almost always only one baby born at a time, but twins occur on rare occasion.</p><p>Mother ___s are very affectionate and protective toward their babies, touching and licking them frequently. When the calves are a month old, they join a "nursery" group made up of several mothers and their calves. The young are always being watched over by one of the adult females. The mothers may browse at a distance, but they return often to nurse their babies. The young ___s stay in these groups until they are a year old.</p><h2>Neck and Neck (and Neck and Neck and…)</h2><p>While female ___s live together in family groups, males live in bachelor groups. Each bachelor group has a number of young males led by an older, larger bull.</p><p>Even though they live in herds, ___s usually don\'t stay in the <strong>same</strong> herd forever. Individuals may come and go, so the makeup of a group is always changing.</p><h2>Saving Their Necks</h2><p>Though ___s aren\'t in immediate danger of extinction, they\'re considered to be <strong>near threatened</strong>. They suffer from two main problems: habitat loss and hunting. As the human population grows and settlements expand, ___s are crowded out of their habitat. At the same time, the animals are being poached for meat and for their body parts: hair for making bracelets and thread, skin for shield covers, and sinew for bowstrings.</p><p>What can you do to help ___s and other wild animals? Don\'t buy products made from their body parts, and encourage others not to buy them either.</p><h2>Fun Facts</h2><ul><li>Ever see a drunken ___? It\'s possible! ___s like to eat maroela berries, which tend to ferment in their stomachs. When they eat too many berries, the ___s become intoxicated and stagger around. This might look funny, but the animals can be in serious danger if they fall and break a leg.</li><li>___s are fast runners, reaching speeds of 35 miles per hour. That\'s about as fast as a good horse!</li><li>Every ___ has a unique pattern of spots, much like a human fingerprint.</li></ul><p>Class: Mammalia<br />Order: Artiodactyla<br />Family: Giraffidae</p>        </section>',
