Its habit of charging at moving objects makes it a mammal to be avoided, especially since its eyesight isn't great.</p><p>This species has two horns. The front (anterior) horn is larger and measures up to 55 inches, while the rear (posterior) horn is smaller and measures up to 22 inches. ___ horns are made of keratin, or densely compressed hair. Keratin is the same material that makes up human hair and fingernails.</p><h2>What's in a Name?</h2><p>___ ___ceros are actually not ___ at all. The species probably derives its name as a distinction from the white ___ (itself a misnomer) and/or from the dark-colored local soil that often covers its skin after wallowing in mud.</p><h2>Territorial Vegetarians</h2><p>Living primarily in grasslands, savannahs and tropical bush lands, ___ ___s are browsers with prehensile upper lips adapted for grasping and holding leaves and branches of shrubs and trees.</p><p>___ ___s are semi-social and territorial. Adult females have overlapping ranges while males are generally solitary and may be territorial. ___ ___ home ranges vary greatly depending on the habitat and to some extent on sex and age.</p><p>___ ___s may live up to 35 years in the wild. Females reach sexual maturity between ages 4 and 7; males mature between ages 7 and 10. Gestation lasts approximately 14-16 months, with a single calf being the norm every 2-1/2 to 3 years.</p><h2>Critically Endangered</h2><p>Millions of years ago, ___s could be found in North America and Europe as well as in Africa and Asia. There are five surviving ___ species, three of which are critically endangered. The ___ ___ and white ___ are found in Africa, while the greater one-horned ___, Sumatran ___, and Javan ___ call Asia home.</p><p>During the last century, the ___ ___ has suffered the most drastic decline in total numbers of all ___ species. Between 1970 and 1992, its population dropped by 96%. By 1993, only 2,300 individuals survived in the wild. The current population is estimated to be 5,055.</p><h3>Illegal Poaching</h3><p>The ___ ___ceros has been pushed to the brink of extinction by illegal poaching for their horns, and to a lesser extent by loss of habitat. A major market for these horns, Arab nations use them to make ornately carved handles for ceremonial daggers. The horn is also falsely believed to be medicine in many Asian cultures. ___ horn is made of keratin, which is the same protein that makes up hair and fingernails. With the growing purchasing power of many Asian countries and the existence of organized gangs of poachers, the threat to ___s remains great.<span style="font-size: 1.6rem;"> </span></p><img border="0" class="ccm-image-block" alt="" src="/files/4314/7449/2255/___-Poaching-Chart-2016.jpg" width="800" height="590" /><h3>Help for ___s</h3><p>In response, a group of concerned individuals and institutions founded the ___ ___ Foundation in 1989. In 1993, this foundation expanded its mission and became the <a href="http://www.___s.org/">International ___ Foundation</a>, which is dedicated to ___ conservation and research. Conservationists' intensive anti-poaching efforts had encouraging results in the 1990s and 2000s and the number of ___ ___s in the wild began increasing very slowly. Unfortunately, there has been a resurgence of poaching in recent years and this activity is again posing a significant threat to wild ___ ___ populations. Current estimates show 5,055 individual ___ ___s are now alive - all precious representatives of the glorious history of the ___ family.</p><h2>Zoo Supports Conservation in the Wild</h2><p>The Saint Louis Zoo's WildCare Institute <a title="Conservation in the Horn of Africa" href="/conservation/wildcare-institute/conservationinthehornofafr/">Center for Conservation in the Horn of Africa</a> was established to provide<em> in situ</em> and <em>ex situ</em> conservation support for the wildlife of the Horn of Africa. This center's work in Kenya with the Northern Rangelands Trust benefits ___ ___s. In addition, each year the <a title="American Association of Zoo Keepers" href="/animals/soyouwanttobeazookeeper/americanassociationofzooke/">St. Louis Chapter of American Association of Zoo Keepers</a> (AAZK) sponsors Bowling for ___s, a fundraising bowl-a-thon which supports the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy in Kenya, Ujung Kulon National Park in Java, Indonesia and Bukit Barisan Selatan and Way Kambas National Parks in Sumatra.</p><p>On March 11, 2016 a female ___ ___ in Sera Community ___ Sanctuary, Kenya, gave birth to a healthy calf, and made history. This is the first ___ ___ to be born on community land in northern Kenya for over 25 years, and demonstrates the strength of the growing community conservation movement. The calf also represents the community's hopes that the Sanctuary can nurture a viable breeding population of ___ ___; that could eventually help repopulate other community conservation areas. <a href="http://www.nrt-kenya.org/news-list/2016/3/21/press-release-sera-community-___-sanctuary-celebrate-first-___-___-birth">Read more</a>. The Zoo's WildCare Institute and AAZK have provided funding to the Sera Community ___ Sanctuary.</p><h2>At the Saint Louis Zoo</h2><p>Because of their endangered status, the Zoo's ___ ___s are part of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' ___ ___ Species Survival Plan (SSP), a program to manage a genetically healthy population of ___ ___s in North American zoos. Currently there are 60 ___ ___s in 26 institutions. In all, 10 ___ ___ calves have been born at the Saint Louis Zoo.</p><p>Ruka, the first ___ ___ceros to be born at the Saint Louis Zoo in 20 years was born January 14, 2011, to first-time parents, mother Kati Rain and father Ajabu. At age 4, Ruka moved to the Oregon Zoo to pair with a compatible female at the recommendation of the SSP. Ruka's parents live at River's Edge.</p><p>Male calf <a title="___ Calf" href="/animals/abouttheanimals/mammals/hoofedmammals/______ceros/___calf/">Moyo</a> was born on May 17, 2017 to the same parents. His name means "heart" in Swaheli. He weighed in at 130 pounds at 1 week old and tipped the scales at 205 pounds at 1 month old.</p>        </section>
