You might think its neck has a lot of bones, but in reality it has just seven - the same as most other mammals. The ___'s neck bones just happen to be much longer!</p><h2>World Record Holder</h2><p>The ___ is the tallest living land animal. Males can reach a height of 16 to 18 feet while females are somewhat smaller at 14 to 16 feet.</p><p>___s are known for their spotted coats. Different subspecies (types) of ___s have different patterns of spots. Reticulated ___s (the kind we have at the Saint Louis Zoo) have large brown spots separated by cream-colored lines. Males are darker than females.</p><h2>Treetop Treats</h2><p>These animals have no competition when it comes to finding food. Their long neck helps them browse in a place that other animals can't reach: the treetops. Trees - including acacia, mimosa, and wild apricot - provide ___s' favorite foods: leaves, fruits, and seedpods. ___s spend many hours each day feasting on treetop treats.</p><p>Since leaves provide a lot of moisture, ___s don't need to drink very often. They can go without water for many weeks, even months, at a time. Lucky thing - ever see a ___ drink from a pond? They have to spread their legs very, very wide to stoop low enough to drink!</p><h2>Sharp Senses</h2><p>___s have extremely keen eyesight and can see great distances: they can spot a moving person a mile away! They also have excellent hearing. These sharp senses help ___s stay alert for predators - like lions!</p><h2>Gentle Giants (and Their Babies)</h2><p>Males will spar, gently, for the attention of a potential mate. These sparring matches are called "neck-knocking" because - you guessed it! - they knock necks. The males rarely bite or kick during these bouts, and injuries are rare.</p><p>After a male and female pair up and mate, they have a while to wait for the birth of their baby: about 15 months! There is almost always only one baby born at a time, but twins occur on rare occasion.</p><p>Mother ___s are very affectionate and protective toward their babies, touching and licking them frequently. When the calves are a month old, they join a "nursery" group made up of several mothers and their calves. The young are always being watched over by one of the adult females. The mothers may browse at a distance, but they return often to nurse their babies. The young ___s stay in these groups until they are a year old.</p><h2>Neck and Neck (and Neck and Neck andâ€¦)</h2><p>While female ___s live together in family groups, males live in bachelor groups. Each bachelor group has a number of young males led by an older, larger bull.</p><p>Even though they live in herds, ___s usually don't stay in the <strong>same</strong> herd forever. Individuals may come and go, so the makeup of a group is always changing.</p><h2>Saving Their Necks</h2><p>Though ___s aren't in immediate danger of extinction, they're considered to be <strong>near threatened</strong>. They suffer from two main problems: habitat loss and hunting. As the human population grows and settlements expand, ___s are crowded out of their habitat. At the same time, the animals are being poached for meat and for their body parts: hair for making bracelets and thread, skin for shield covers, and sinew for bowstrings.</p><p>What can you do to help ___s and other wild animals? Don't buy products made from their body parts, and encourage others not to buy them either.</p><h2>Fun Facts</h2><ul><li>Ever see a drunken ___? It's possible! ___s like to eat maroela berries, which tend to ferment in their stomachs. When they eat too many berries, the ___s become intoxicated and stagger around. This might look funny, but the animals can be in serious danger if they fall and break a leg.</li><li>___s are fast runners, reaching speeds of 35 miles per hour. That's about as fast as a good horse!</li><li>Every ___ has a unique pattern of spots, much like a human fingerprint.</li></ul><p>Class: Mammalia<br />Order: Artiodactyla<br />Family: Giraffidae</p>        </section>
