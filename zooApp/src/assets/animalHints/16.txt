This large ___ is named for its long, swan-like neck. The neck is strikingly colored - - the back side is dark brown and the front is a pale cream color. The bird&rsquo;s bill is also distinctive: it&rsquo;s all black but a bright white band separates it from the head.</p><p>The swan ___ feeds almost exclusively on plants, including sedges.

Threats include habitat loss from agricultural development, dam construction, and the grazing and cutting of marsh vegetation, as well as unsustainable levels of hunting.</p>        </section>
