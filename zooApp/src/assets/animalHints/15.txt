The tail comes in handy as a rudder as the bird dives underwater in search of aquatic plants, insects and mollusks. In addition to diving head-first, the ruddy ___ can gradually lower itself under water to feed, making it look like the bird is sinking!</p><p>In the summer breeding season, the male ruddy ___ is a bright chestnut color with white cheeks, a black head, and a brilliant blue bill. At other times of year, he resembles the females' year-round color. She's a dusky brown with pale cheeks and a black bill. This drab color helps hide her as she sits on the nest, surrounded by dense vegetation.</p>        </section>
