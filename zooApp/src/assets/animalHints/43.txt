The boldly-colored males can grow up to 9 feet tall and weigh as much as 350 pounds. Females are smaller and are drab-colored to blend in with their surroundings.</p><p>Since they can't fly, ___es are forced to nest on the ground, which leaves their eggs more vulnerable to predators. To better protect the eggs, females often combine their eggs into a single large nest, which is cared for by the dominant female and her mate. If there are more eggs than the female can cover, she will roll away ones that aren't hers - - an amazing behavior since the eggs all look alike to us!</p><p>___es use their powerful legs to kick attacking predators, or to run away at speeds of up to 40 miles per hour.</p>        </section>
