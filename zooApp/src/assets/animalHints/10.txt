They eat both plants and animals, and are very adept at fishing for salmon and trout. They rely on their sense of smell more than their hearing or sight, and often stand on their hind legs to sniff their surroundings.

While grizzlies are confined to northwestern North America, other types of brown ___s are found in Europe, northern Asia and Japan. The species as a whole is found in fairly healthy numbers worldwide (200,000 or more). But their <a title="Conservation Status" href="/conservationstatus/conservationstatus/">Conservation Status</a> hides the fact that many brown ___ populations are in danger of extinction. This is certainly true of grizzlies. <span style="font-size: 1.6rem;">Once found throughout the mountains of western North America, habitat loss and hunting have reduced their numbers to only about 1,500 in the lower 48 states. Of these, about 800 live in Montana. In 2016, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) proposed removing ___ ___s from protection within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) under the Endangered Species Act (called delisting).</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.6rem;"> ___ ___s were designated, or listed, as threatened with extinction in 1975. Various agencies and stakeholder groups hold differing opinions about the status of the population and how it should be managed in the future. In the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the population of grizzyly ___s has grown from 136 in 1975 to about 700 today. According to USFWS, efforts to reduce conflicts with people and preserve habitat for dispersal and, eventually, connectivity with other populations outside of the GYE will be essential for further restoration</span></p><p><span style="color: #4c6ba9; font-size: 32px; font-weight: bold;">Did You Know?</span></p><p>A ___ ___ can sprint 30 to 35 miles an hour over short distances -- faster than many horses.</p>        </section>
