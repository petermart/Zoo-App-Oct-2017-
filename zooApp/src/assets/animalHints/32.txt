Overall, the species is the smallest of the ___ equids (horses, ___es, and zebras). A typical African ___ ___ stands about four feet at the shoulder and weighs about 600 pounds. (To put it in perspective, the average <a title="Grevy's Zebra" href="/animals/abouttheanimals/mammals/hoofedmammals/grevyszebra/">Grevy's zebra </a>stands five feet at the shoulder and weighs 900 pounds.)</p><h2>Check Out Those Legs!</h2><p>___ ___ ___es are mostly gray in color, with a white belly. They do have one outstanding feature: the horizontal stripes on their legs. With legs like that, it's no surprise these animals are closely related to zebras.</p><p>Like all African ___ ___es, the ___ subspecies has long, narrow hooves -- the narrowest of any equid. This unique design allows the animals to be swift and surefooted in their rough, rocky habitat.</p><h2>This ___ Eats Gr___</h2><p>Gr___ is the favored food of ___ ___ ___es, but they also eat shrubs and other desert plants. Like many other grazing animals, they first grasp a plant with their strong lips, pull it into their mouth, and then tear it off with their teeth. The teeth are large and have flat surfaces -- perfect for tearing and chewing even the toughest plants.</p><p>These animals graze mostly when it's cooler -- at dawn, dusk, and during the night. During the heat of the day, they often retreat to rocky hills to rest in shady spots.</p><p>Given their hot environment, it's no surprise that ___ ___ ___es stay within easy reach of water: they generally don't wander more than 20 miles from a drinking source. They can go without water longer than other equids, but they still need to drink at least once every two or three days.</p><h2>Foaling Around</h2><p>By the time a male ___ ___ ___ has reached his second year, he is capable of breeding. However, because he has to compete with older, stronger males, he's unlikely to mate before he's four years old. Females, on the other hand, generally begin breeding at the ripe old age of two.</p><p>Pregnancy lasts for about one year, after which a female gives birth to (usually) a single foal. Though the female is capable of having a new baby every year, it's more likely that she'll breed once every two years.</p><h2>To Group or Not To Group</h2><p>Mothers can always be found with their dependent foals, but otherwise there are no predictable groupings of ___ ___ ___es. Some animals (usually males) are solitary, living alone for periods of time. Others live in herds (all-male, mares and foals, or mixed herds), which can have up to 50 members. But these groups are flexible, and animals change herds frequently.</p><p>Some stallions defend territories, often around water supplies. A territory covers about nine square miles, on average. Within his home turf, the dominant stallion will tolerate males of lower status -- as long as they recognize his superiority!</p><h2>Equids in Danger</h2><p>All subspecies of the African ___ ___ (including the ___ ___ ___) are critically endangered. This means they face an extremely high risk of extinction in the ___.</p><p>___ populations have declined for a number of reasons. For one thing, some local people have been known to hunt the ___es for food and for use in traditional medicine. (Some native people believe the animals' fat is an effective treatment for tuberculosis.) Hunting has taken a greater toll in recent years, as political unrest in the area has allowed better access to automatic weapons.</p><p>African ___ ___es face other problems, brought about by increasing human populations and the expansion of agriculture. More and more, ___ ___es are competing with domestic livestock for limited grazing grounds and water sources. And as the ___ and domestic animals come into contact, there is more and more interbreeding -- another serious threat to ___ ___es.</p><p>African ___ ___es need help if they're going to survive in the ___. An essential first step is surveying the ___ populations to learn their numbers and distribution. This work is beginning now, through a partnership between the Ethiopian ___life Conservation Organization and the Saint Louis Zoo (see side story). These surveys will enable the researchers to develop detailed conservation strategies. Through these efforts, we hope to help African ___ ___es survive where they belong -- in the ___.</p><h2>Fun Facts</h2><ul><li>They may be small, but they're fast: African ___ ___es have been clocked at 30 miles per hour.</li><li>In the 16th century, the Spanish brought domesticated African ___ ___es to the southwestern United States. The descendants of those animals -- best known as burros -- still roam through the Southwest.</li></ul><p>Cl___: Mammalia<br />Order: Perissodactyla<br />Family: Equidae</p>        </section>
