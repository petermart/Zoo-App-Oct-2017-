In the wild, they typically live in groups, or “harems,” that include a bull and 10 to 15 cows. During their summer-long breeding ___son, they collect by the thousands on isolated coastlines and islands.

They can dive to depths of up to 1,000 feet – that’s the length of almost three football fields. When a ___ ___ dives, its inner ears and nostrils close. Tears continually wash over their eyes to protect them.</p><p>___ ___s can remain under water for up to 20 minutes at a time. Unlike dolphins (and humans), ___ ___s actually exhale before a dive. They can stay underwater for long periods because they have a high tolerance for carbon dioxide.</p></div>    </li>      <li>      <input type="radio" name="accordion-27155" id="toggle-27155-6" >      <label for="toggle-27155-6"><span>Are You My Mother?</span></label>      <div><p>Mothers recognize pups on crowded rookeries through smell and vocalizations.
